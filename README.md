# specmatch-emp-apf
Modifications to cameronn's version of specmatch-emp 

This verions of specmatch-emp uses Cameron Nunez's modifications and additions (stevecroft/bl-interns/cameronn) to Samuel Yee's (samuelyeewl/specmatch-emp) Specmatch-Emp model.
Cameron's modifications allowed the model to read in APF spectra instead of Keck HIRES spectra.
New modifications in this version include use of Jackie Telson's (stevecroft/bl-interns/jackietel) deblazing function written in python instead of the original R deblazing function, slight changes to allow the model to work in my python environment (for example, python verion compatibility issues).

NOTE: The current scripts need to be updated!
